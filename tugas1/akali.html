        <p>Ionia has always been a land of wild magic, its vibrant people and powerful spirits seeking 
            to live in harmony… but sometimes this peaceful equilibrium does not come easily.
             Sometimes it needs to be kept in check.</p>
        <p>The Kinkou are the self-appointed keepers of Ionia’s sacred balance. The order’s loyal acolytes walk the spirit and material realms,
            mediating conflicts between them and, when necessary, intervening by force. Born among their ranks was Akali, daughter of Mayym Jhomen Tethi,
            the renowned Fist of Shadow. Mayym and her partner Tahno raised their daughter within the Kinkou Order, under the watchful leadership of Great Master Kusho, the Eye of Twilight.</p>
        <p>Whenever her parents were called away, other members of the order stepped in as Akali’s surrogate family. Kennen, the Heart of the Tempest,
             spent many hours with the young girl, teaching her shuriken techniques, and emphasizing speed and agility over strength. Akali was a precocious child, 
             and soaked up the knowledge like a sponge. It became clear to all that she would follow her parents’ path—along with the Great Master’s son and appointed successor Shen, 
             she would lead a new generation dedicated to preserving Ionia’s balance.</p>

        <p>Passive: <br>
        ASSASSIN'S MARK, Dealing spell damage to a champion creates a ring of energy around them. Exiting that ring empowers Akali's next autoattack with bonus range and damage.

        <p>Skill 1: <br>
        FIVE POINT STRIKE, Akali throws out five kunai, dealing damage based on her bonus Attack Damage and Ability Power and slowing.
            </p>
        <p>Skill 2: <br>
        TWILIGHT SHROUD, Akali drops a cover of smoke and briefly gains Movement Speed. While inside the shroud, Akali becomes invisible and unable to be selected by enemy spells and attacks. Attacking or using abilities will briefly reveal her.
            </p>
        <p>Skill 3: <br>
        SHURIKEN FLIP, Flip backward and fire a shuriken forward, dealing magic damage. The first enemy or smoke cloud hit is marked. Re-cast to dash to the marked target, dealing additional damage.

        <p>Ionia, Surrounded by treacherous seas, Ionia is composed of a number of allied provinces scattered across a massive archipelago, known to many as the First Lands. Since Ionian culture has long been shaped by the pursuit of balance in all things, the border between the material and spirit realms tends to be more permeable here, especially in the wild forests and mountains.
            Although these lands’ enchantments can be fickle, its creatures dangerous and fae, for many centuries most Ionians led lives of plenty. The warrior monasteries, provincial militias—and even Ionia itself—had been enough to protect them.</p>
        <p>But that ended twelve years ago, when Noxus attacked the First Lands. The empire’s seemingly endless warhosts savaged Ionia, and were only defeated after many years, and at great cost.
            Now, Ionia exists in an uneasy peace. Different reactions to the war have divided the region—some groups, such as the Shojin monks or the Kinkou, seek a return to isolationist pacifism, and pastoral traditions. Other more radical factions, such as the Navori Brotherhood and the Order of Shadow, demand a militarization of the land’s magic, to create a single, unified nation that can take vengeance on Noxus.
            The fate of Ionia hangs in a delicate balance that few are willing to overturn, but all can feel shifting uneasily beneath their feet.
